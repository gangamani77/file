The Online Quiz Game Project is a simple web-based quiz game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project consists of three main components: the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality.

Game Flow:
The quiz starts by displaying the first question.
The user selects an answer. The system checks if it's correct and updates the score.
A "Next Question" button is shown after each selection, leading to the next question.
Once all questions are answered, the final score is displayed.

It can be easily extended with additional features, such as timers, question randomization, and user authentication.It can be easily extended with additional features, such as timers, question randomization, and user authentication.
